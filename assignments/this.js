/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window - When 'this' isnt used inside of an object, it binds to the window (which is the first object it sees in its scope)
* 2. implicit - This is when 'this' is used inside of an object literal. 'this' then binds to the object it's inside of.
* 3. New binding - This binds 'this' to the object returned by the constructor. In other words, when you use new to create a new object, 'this' binds to that new object.
* 4. 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
